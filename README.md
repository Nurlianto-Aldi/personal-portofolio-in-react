# Personal Portofolio Website in React.js
I am a Front-End Web Developer with a distinctive background in Marketing Management, where I spent over three years driving growth and operational efficiency in startup settings. This transition has armed me with a powerful combination of technical expertise and business insight.

I build robust applications using React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Crucially, my history in business strategy, market analysis, and negotiation translates directly into strong project management, stakeholder communication, and solution-driven problem-solving. I am eager to leverage this unique duality to create user-centric and scalable software that directly supports high-level business goals and accelerates company development.
